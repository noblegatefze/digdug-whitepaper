DIGDUG.DO AND USDDD

This repository contains the public protocol documentation for DIGDUG.DO and the USDDD monetary system.

DIGDUG.DO is a decentralized protocol for permissionless, on-chain distribution of digital assets. It provides a neutral mechanism for sponsors to distribute tokens to real participants without discretionary control, centralized allocation, or manual moderation.

USDDD is a native utility-denominated unit used within the DIGDUG.DO ecosystem. It is not introduced as a stablecoin at inception. Its role, supply behavior, and any future stability characteristics are defined by usage rather than guarantees or pegs.

This repository is not marketing material. It is a protocol-level specification intended to document design goals, economic constraints, and execution principles.

The primary document is the whitepaper:

WHITEPAPER.md

Additional files:
- CHANGELOG.md documents public revisions
- LICENSE defines usage permissions

This documentation is a living record and may evolve. Core principles are intended to remain stable.
