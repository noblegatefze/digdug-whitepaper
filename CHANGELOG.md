CHANGELOG

Version 0.1

Initial public release of the DIGDUG.DO and USDDD protocol documentation.

This release establishes:
- The DIGDUG.DO protocol purpose and design philosophy
- The participant and sponsor model
- Distribution mechanics and abuse-resistance principles
- The role, supply philosophy, and long-term vision for USDDD

The whitepaper was intentionally rewritten into plain technical prose to function as a protocol specification rather than marketing material.
